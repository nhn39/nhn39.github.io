<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>This section will contain information about me.</p>
    Nam Nguyen is a recent DMA graduate from Temple University. His dissertation, &quot;Solo Piano
Music by Vietnamese Composers: A Performative and Historical Perspective,&quot; explores the rich
tapestry of Vietnamese piano repertoire through both a performative and historical lens. His
principal teachers have included Ha Thu Tran, Harvey Wedeen, and Ching-Yun Hu. Additionally,
Nam studied collaborative piano with Lambert Orkis and early keyboard instruments with Joyce
Lindorff.
Nam began his piano training at the age of six at the Vietnam Academy of Music before coming
to Temple. Despite his early exposure to piano in Vietnam, he had limited experience with
classical music by Vietnamese composers and was unfamiliar with many works in the repertoire.
The development of Classical Music in America, highlighted by innovative composers such as
Charles Ives and George Gershwin, ignited his interest in his own culture. This led him to
research Vietnamese piano music for his dissertation. He is continuing his research on
Vietnamese music beyond the scope of his dissertation through his work with the Center for
Vietnamese Philosophy, Culture, and Society.
Currently based in Philadelphia, Nam is working as a professional musician, engaging in both
solo and collaborative performances. In addition to performing, Nam is passionate about
teaching and has been instructing students of various ages and skill levels. Whether through
performance, teaching, or collaboration, Nam is committed to enriching the musical landscape
with his unique perspectives and expertise.
